# Walk_Run_Classification

WalkRun Classification using SVM offers a promising solution for efficient and accuracte classification of weather the person is walking or running. By leveraging the different classification machine learning algorithm, it enables the real time analysis and with accuracy of more than 99.5% it almost predict correct class everytime. The project successfully built a robust and accurate activity classification model. This system can be integrated into wearable devices, fitness applications, and healthcare monitoring systems to track human movement efficiently.
